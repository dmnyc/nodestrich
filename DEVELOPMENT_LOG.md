# Nodestrich Development Log

## Project Overview
Complete rebuild of Nodestrich.com from PHP/Dreamhost to modern Next.js stack with git-based content management system.

## Development Session: September 26, 2025

### Initial Planning & Architecture Decision
- **Goal**: Rebuild Nodestrich.com with better design and Lightning Network knowledge base
- **Architecture Choice**: Database-free approach using static generation + API calls
- **Key Requirements**:
  - Community contribution system via git
  - Preserve existing member directory functionality
  - Add comprehensive Lightning Network knowledge base
  - Enable community-driven content contributions

### Technology Stack Selected
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with App Router + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (matching original dark theme)
- **Content**: MDX with frontmatter for git-based content management
- **Data**: Hybrid approach - Amboss API + static generation
- **Deployment**: Vercel with automatic deployments
- **No Database**: Pure static + API approach for simplicity

### Implementation Progress

#### Phase 1: Foundation Setup âœ…
- Created Next.js 15 project with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Set up project structure with proper routing (`/learn`, `/community`, `/tools`)
- Migrated original assets (logo, icons, social preview image)
- Configured environment variables for Amboss API

#### Phase 2: API Integration âœ…
- **Amboss API Migration**: Converted PHP GraphQL calls to Next.js API routes
- **Type Safety**: Created TypeScript interfaces for all API responses
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling and fallbacks
- **Caching Strategy**: Build-time static generation + runtime updates

#### Phase 3: Core Components âœ…
- **Navigation**: Responsive navigation with mobile menu
- **Community Stats**: Animated counters matching original UX
- **Member Directory**: Searchable grid with Amboss profile links
- **Layout System**: Consistent dark theme and responsive design

#### Phase 4: Knowledge Base System âœ…
- **MDX Integration**: Full MDX support with syntax highlighting
- **Content Structure**: Organized by difficulty (beginner/intermediate/advanced)
- **Dynamic Routing**: `[...slug]` routing for flexible article URLs
- **Frontmatter Support**: Rich metadata for categorization and search

#### Phase 5: Search & Discovery âœ…
- **Search API**: `/api/search` endpoint for content queries
- **Real-time Search**: Client-side search with debouncing
- **Search UI**: Dropdown results with category and tag filtering
- **Content Organization**: Clear categorization and tagging system

#### Phase 6: Content Creation âœ…
- **Initial Articles**: Created sample content for each difficulty level
  - Beginner: "Getting Started with Lightning Network"
  - Intermediate: "Channel Management Best Practices"
  - Advanced: "Advanced Routing Optimization"
- **Content Guidelines**: Established structure and writing standards

#### Phase 7: Community Contribution System âœ…
- **Git Workflow**: Pull request-based content contributions
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README and CONTRIBUTING.md
- **Templates**: Content templates and guidelines for contributors
- **Recognition System**: Contributor attribution and community building

#### Phase 8: Deployment Configuration âœ…
- **Vercel Setup**: Configured for automatic deployments
- **Environment Variables**: Documented required environment setup
- **Build Optimization**: Static generation with API route optimization
- **Performance**: Optimized for fast loading and SEO

### Key Technical Decisions

#### Database-Free Architecture
**Decision**: No database, pure static + API approach
**Reasoning**:
- Simplifies maintenance and reduces costs
- Git becomes the content management system
- Scales automatically with static hosting
- No database migration or maintenance needed
- Community can contribute via familiar git workflow

#### Hybrid Data Loading
**Decision**: Build-time static generation + runtime API updates
**Reasoning**:
- Fast initial page loads with static data
- Real-time stats updates for current information
- Fallback to cached data if API fails
- Best of both worlds for performance and freshness

#### MDX Content System
**Decision**: MDX files with frontmatter instead of CMS
**Reasoning**:
- Version control for all content changes
- Community can contribute via pull requests
- No vendor lock-in or additional services
- Familiar markdown syntax with React component support

#### Component-Based Architecture
**Decision**: Modular, typed React components
**Benefits**:
- Reusable UI components
- Type safety throughout application
- Easy to maintain and extend
- Clear separation of concerns

### Current Status: COMPLETE âœ…

#### Working Features
- âœ… Community dashboard with real-time Amboss stats
- âœ… Animated counters matching original site UX
